# Playlist_Project

I am relatively new to programming and am largely self-taught. This playlist "plays" music by listing the first line of the song.
It allows users to create playlists, add songs (including the first line of the song), counts the number 
of times a song has been played, allows for adding those songs to specific playlists,
allows users to name playlists,  remove songs from the library (from all playlists and the system), etc.
