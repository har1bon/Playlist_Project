# Playlist_Project

I am relatively new to programming and am largely self-taught. This playlist "plays" music by listing the first line of the song.
It allows users to create playlists, add songs and the first line of the song, add those songs to playlists, counts the number of times
a song has been played, allows users to name playlists,  remove songs from the library (from all playlists and the system), etc.
